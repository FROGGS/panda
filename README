Pies is a module management solution for Perl 6.
The Pies itself is a specification (like masak's Pls[1]), and cannot
install anything itself. The project ships two implementations:
ufobuilder, being an extremely simple example implementation of Pies,
and Panda, being the actual module manager to use. The bootstrap.sh
script should install Panda along with all its dependencies, so it can
be used like:

$ panda Acme::Meow
