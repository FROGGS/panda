DESCRIPTION

Pies is a module management solution for Perl 6.
The Pies itself is a specification (like masak's Pls[1]), and cannot
install anything itself. The project ships two implementations:
ufobuilder, being an extremely simple example implementation of Pies,
and Panda, being the actual module manager to use.

INSTALLATION

To install Panda along with all its dependencies, simply run script
bootstrap.sh. This works good in *NIX environment.
However, some problems exist with installation in Windows environment
at the moment.

USAGE

Panda can be used like:

$ panda install Acme::Meow

Note that ~/.perl6/bin has to be in your $PATH for you to be able to use
panda from the command line.

More features and docs on the way.
