* Change bootstrap/rebootstrap to install panda from a full directory path
  rather than from '.', so that the statefile can track the source dir
* Fix DESTDIR to know the difference between absolute and relative paths
* Support DESTDIR as way to build deployable package
  - don't modify statefile when DESTDIR is set unless DESTDIR is ~/.perl6/
  - envvar to use a different statefile?
* Finish verbose-list branch
  - save 'git describe --always --dirty' result in saved-meta
  - make 'panda list' output narrower by default
    . with a --verbose option for more?
  - show both installed and available version in 'panda list' or 'panda info'
  - merge branch back
* Keep track of the installed files so they can be removed later
  - it's tricky if they're installed to some DESTDIR
* Retain --notests and --nodeps setting in statefile, so that rebootstrap
  can survive rebuilding projects that require these settings
* Get to full Windows compatibility
* Merge with panda-niecza?
* Update README.md to represent current reality
